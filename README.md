# 3-axis-floor-joystick
This is a design based on the Akaki pipechair-cockpit in form factor, but with a total design of the moving assemblies to address issues with stiffness, tolerances and ease of assembly. Apart from 3D printed components, the system uses 16mm aluminium tube for its structure and axles, press-fit plain bearings, and AS5600 rotary encoders for all axes
